# 13. ILLUSTRATION OF CSV FILE PROGRAMMING– III
# Develop a menu driven program implementing the user defined functions to perform different
# functions on a csv file named contacts.csv(name, phone)
#     1. Append a contact
#     2. Count the number of contacts in the file
#     3. Display all contacts
#     3. Exit
