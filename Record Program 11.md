# 11. ILLUSTRATION OF CSV FILE PROGRAMMINGâ€“ I
Develop a menu driven program implementing the user defined functions
to perform different functions on a csv file named mobile.csv(modelid, modelname, modelprice)
1. Append a record
2. Updating a record based on modelid
3. Display all
4. Exit

## Source Code
```py
import csv

f = open("mobile.csv", "a") # Ensure that the file exists
f.close()

def appendMobile():
    mID = input("Enter model ID: ")
    mName = input("Enter model Name: ")
    mPrice = input("Enter model Price: ")

    with open("mobile.csv", "a", newline="") as f:
        wr = csv.writer(f)
        wr.writerow([mID, mName , mPrice])
    
    print("Record appended to file")

def updateMobile():
    mID = input("Enter model ID: ")
    mName = input("Enter new model Name: ")
    mPrice = input("Enter new model Price: ")

    newrows = []
    with open("mobile.csv", "r", newline="") as f:
        re = csv.reader(f)
        for row in re:
            newrows.append(row)
    
    with open("mobile.csv", "w", newline="") as f:
        wr = csv.writer(f)
        for row in newrows:
            if row[0] == mID:
                wr.writerow([mID, mName , mPrice])
            else:
                wr.writerow(row)
    
    print("Updated record")
    print("--------------------")
    print("modelID:", mID)
    print("Name   :", mName)
    print("Price  :", mPrice)
    print("--------------------")

    rows = []
    with open("mobile.csv", "r", newline="") as f:
        re = csv.reader(f)
        for row in re:
            rows.append(row)
    
    for row in rows:
        print("--------------------")
        print("modelID:", row[0])
        print("Name   :", row[1])
        print("Price  :", row[2])
        print("--------------------")

        break

    else:
