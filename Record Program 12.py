# 12. ILLUSTRATION OF CSV FILE PROGRAMMINGâ€“ II
# Develop a menu driven program implementing the user defined functions to perform
# different functions on a csv file named library.csv(bookid, bookname, noofcopies)
#     1. Append a record
#     2. Searching a record based on bookid
#     3. Display all
#     4. Exit
